# Hi there! 👋

I'm Chukwuemelie Obumse, a software engineer interested in full stack web development. Thanks for stopping by my Github page! 🚀

# About Me

I specialize in backend engineering, proficiently using JavaScript (Node.js) and the Express.js framework as well as Python and the Flask framework. Additionally, I have some experience with TypeScript. I have practical knowledge of working with Linux, including tasks related to system administration, web stack debugging, and some DevOps practices. I am also skilled in Bash scripting, which allows me to automate tasks and improve efficiency in system management. For database management, I have experience working with both MySQL and MongoDB. In MySQL, I am familiar with using SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.

Other skills I have include Git for version control, and basic knowledge of using Redis and the C programming language. I also have a strong foundation in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

When I'm not coding, you can find me watching football matches, playing video games, watching anime & TV shows, or reading comic books. I love exploring new things and learning new skills.

# Soft Skills

👨🏾‍💼 I possess strong communication skills, both verbal and written, with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

💪 I'm self-motivated and proactive, with the ability to work independently or as part of a team.

📚 I'm adaptable and flexible, with the ability to quickly learn new technologies and processes.
