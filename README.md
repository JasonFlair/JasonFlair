# Hi there! 👋

I'm Chukwuemelie Obumse, a software engineer interested in full stack web development. Thanks for stopping by my Github page! 🚀

# About Me

I specialize in Python, specifically web development using Flask. I'm also experienced in Linux (System Administration and DevOps), Bash scripting, MySQL database management, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge in JavaScript and C programming.

When I'm not coding, you can find me watching football matches, playing video games, watching anime & TV shows, or reading comic books. I love exploring new things and learning new skills.

# Soft Skills

👨🏾‍💼 I possess strong communication skills, both verbal and written, with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

📝 I'm detail-oriented and highly organized, with the ability to manage multiple projects and deadlines simultaneously.

💪 I'm self-motivated and proactive, with the ability to work independently or as part of a team.

📚 I'm adaptable and flexible, with the ability to quickly learn new technologies and processes.

# Projects

👨🏾‍💻 I have worked on some exciting projects, including an AirBnB clone and a music recommender web application called Flair Vibes Tailor. My Github repositories showcase some of my recent projects, so be sure to check them out!
