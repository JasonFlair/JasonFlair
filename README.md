# Hi there! üëã

I'm Chukwuemelie Obumse, a software engineer interested in full stack web development. Thanks for stopping by my Github page! üöÄ

# About Me

I specialize in backend engineering, proficiently using JavaScript (Node.js) and the Express.js framework as well as Python and the Flask framework to develop efficient and scalable server-side applications that can be seamlessly integrated with the frontend applications. Additionally, I have some experience with TypeScript and Linux systems. I also have knowledge of CI/CD using Jenkins & Fabric and containerization using docker, I am also skilled in Bash scripting. For database management, I have experience working with both MySQL and MongoDB. I also have a strong foundation in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and jQuery with foundational knowledge of React. Other skills I have include Unit testing, Git for version control, Redis for temporary storage systems and the C programming language.

When I'm not coding, you can find me watching football matches, playing video games, watching anime & TV shows, or reading comic books. I love exploring new things and learning new skills.
