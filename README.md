# Hi there! 👋

I'm Chukwuemelie Obumse, a software engineer interested in full stack development. Thanks for stopping by my Github page! 🚀

# About Me

I specialize in backend engineering/development with proficiency in utilizing JavaScript (Node.js) with the Express.js framework and Python with Flask to create efficient, scalable server-side applications. I excel in seamlessly integrating backend systems with frontend applications. Additionally, I possess familiarity with TypeScript and Linux systems. In terms of database management, I've worked extensively with MySQL and MongoDB.

On the frontend, I have hands-on experience with HTML, JSX, Tailwind CSS, React, Material UI, and jQuery.

My expertise extends to supporting DevOps teams through knowledge in CI/CD using Jenkins & Fabric, and containerization using Docker. I'm adept at Bash scripting for task automation. Additionally, I have skills in unit testing, Git for version control, utilizing Redis for temporary storage systems, and proficiency in the C programming language.


When I'm not coding, you can find me watching football matches, playing video games, watching anime & TV shows, or reading comic books. I love exploring new things and learning new skills.
